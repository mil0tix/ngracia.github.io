My routine includes approximately 30 minutes of biking, which can vary depending on whether I&amp;rsquo;m working remotely or other factors. According to the World Health Organisation adults aged between 18-64 years should do at least 150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity, so I always like to do some cardio, moreover it makes me feel good.</description></item><item><title>My setup</title><link>https://noegracia.github.io/posts/my-life/about-me/my-setup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 16:18:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://noegracia.github.io/posts/my-life/about-me/my-setup/</guid><description>Setup My coding setup consists of a dual-monitor arrangement and a high-performance PC featuring a GeForce 3080, an i7-12700KF, 32GB RAM 2400MHz, and a 2TB SSD. This configuration allows me to efficiently handle large datasets and run resource-intensive algorithms, enhancing my productivity.</description></item><item><title>Autoencoder</title><link>https://noegracia.github.io/posts/ai/machine-learning/autoencoder/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 08:11:25 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://noegracia.github.io/posts/ai/machine-learning/autoencoder/</guid><description>Creation of pre-trained autoencoder to learn the initial condensed representation of unlabeled datasets. This architecture consists of 3 parts:
Encoder: Compresses the input data from the train-validation-test set into a coded representation which is typically smaller by several orders of magnitude than the input data. Latent Space: This space contains the compressed knowledge representations and is thus the most crucial part of the network. Decoder: A module that helps the network to &amp;ldquo;decompress&amp;rdquo; the knowledge representations and reconstruct the data from their coded form.</description></item><item><title>Skin Cancer Detection using semantic segmentation</title><link>https://noegracia.github.io/posts/ai/machine-learning/segmentation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 08:13:25 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://noegracia.github.io/posts/ai/machine-learning/segmentation/</guid><description>Skin Cancer Detection Tool README.md Overview The objective of this project is to build a Skin Cancer Detection Tool. The tool that we are creating is a segmentation model of spots (moles, melanomas, etc&amp;hellip;) on microscopic images of the skin. To create this tool we will have to train a semantic segmentation AI model. The data that we use for that training is from The International Skin Imaging Collaboration.
